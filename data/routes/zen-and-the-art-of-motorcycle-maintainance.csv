Location,Latitude,Longitude,CheckpointNotes
"Minneapolis, Minnesota",44.978,-93.265,"I suddenly notice the land here has flattened into a Euclidian plane. Not a hill, not a bump anywhere. This means we have entered the Red River Valley. We will soon be into the Dakotas."
"Ellendale, North Dakota",46.00256,-98.52735,There it is! Ellendale!
"Hague, North Dakota",46.02888,-99.99921,We stop for gas at Hague and ask if there is any way to get across the Missouri between Bismarck and Mobridge. The attendant doesn't know of any.
"Herreid, South Dakota",45.83883,-100.06913,"At Herreid John disappears for a drink while Sylvia and Chris and I find some shade in a park and try to rest. It isn't restful. A change has taken place and I don't know quite what it is. The streets of this town are broad, much broader than they need be, and there is a pallor of dust in the air. Empty lots here and there between the buildings have weeds growing in them. The sheet metal equipment sheds and water tower are like those of previous towns but more spread out. Everything is more run-down and mechanical-looking, and sort of randomly located. Gradually I see what it is. Nobody is concerned anymore about tidily conserving space. The land isn't valuable anymore. We are in a Western town."
"Mobridge, South Dakota",45.537411,-100.43383,"We have lunch of hamburgers and malteds at an A & W place in Mobridge, cruise down a heavily trafficked main street and then there it is, at the bottom of the hill, the Missouri. All that moving water is strange, banked by grass hills that hardly get any water at all."
"Lemmon, South Dakota",45.936,-102.164,By the time we reach Lemmon we are really aching tired. At a bar we hear about a campground to the south.
"US 12, North Dakota",46.119008,-103.043304,"This US 12 is old, bad highway. The broken concrete is tar-patched and bumpy. Road signs indicate detours ahead. On either side of the road are occasional worn sheds and shacks and roadside stands that have accumulated through the years."
"Bowman, North Dakota",46.1830618,-103.3949061,"On the horizon appears an image of buildings, shimmering slightly. I look down at the map and it must be Bowman. I think about ice water and air conditioning."
"Baker, Montana",46.3678114,-104.2752261,"At Baker, where we stop, the thermometers are reading 108 degrees in the shade."
"Miles City, Montana",46.4085273,-105.840981,"It's about ten o'clock in the morning and I'm sitting alongside the machine on a cool, shady curbstone back of a hotel we have found in Miles City, Montana."
"Yellowstone Valley, Montana",45.78496045,-108.6072214,"Now we follow the Yellowstone Valley right across Montana. It changes from Western sagebrush to Midwestern cornfields and back again, depending on whether it's under irrigation from the river. Sometimes we cross over bluffs that take us out of the irrigated area, but usually we stay close to the river. We pass by a marker saying something about Lewis and Clark. One of them came up this way on a side excursion from the Northwest Passage."
"Laurel, Montana",45.669,-108.772,"At Laurel, in sight of the mountains at last, we stop for the night. The evening breeze is cool now. It comes down off the snow. Although the sun must have disappeared behind the mountains an hour ago, there's still good light in the sky from behind the range."
"Cooke City, Montana",45.020038,-109.933599,"At Cooke City John and Sylvia look and sound happier than I have seen them in years, and we whack into our hot beef sandwiches with great whacks. I'm happy to hear and see all their high-country exuberance but don't comment much, just keep eating."
"Gardiner, Montana",45.035,-110.713,"We exit from the park at Gardiner, where not much rain seems to fall, because the mountainsides show only grass and sage in the twilight. We decide to stay here for the night. The town is on high banks on either side of a bridge over a river which rushes over smooth and clean boulders. Across the bridge they've already turned the lights on at the motel where we check in, but even in the artificial light coming from the windows I can see each cabin has been carefully surrounded by planted flowers, and so I step carefully to avoid them."
"Bozeman, Montana",45.679,-111.044,"We reach an intersection where the road from the park joins the main east-west highway, stop and turn on to it."
"Three Forks, Montana",45.892606,-111.551448,"At Three Forks the road cuts into a narrow canyon of whitish-tan rock, past some Lewis and Clark caves."
"Butte, Montana",46.0131505,-112.536508,"East of Butte we go up a long hard grade, cross the Continental Divide, then go down into a valley."
"Anaconda, Montana",46.1294685,-112.953131,"Later we pass the great stack of the Anaconda smelter, turn into the town of Anaconda and find a good restaurant with steak and coffee."
"Phillipsburg, Montana",46.332506,-113.294416,"We pass through Phillipsburg and are off into valley meadows. The head wind becomes more gusty here, so I slow down to fifty-five to lessen it a little."
"Missoula, Montana",46.8701049,-113.995267,"On either side of us the mountains have become steep, to form a long narrow valley that winds into Missoula."
"Lolo Pass, Montana",46.635199,-114.579836,"We stretch our legs for a while, walk around and then somewhat wearily head out of Missoula toward Lolo Pass...All traces of the East are gone now, at least in my imagination. All the rain here comes from Pacific winds and all the rivers and streams here return it to the Pacific. We should be at the ocean in two or three days."
"Grangeville, Idaho",45.926552,-116.122326,"At the top of the plateau at Grangeville, Idaho, we step from the blasting heat into an air-conditioned restaurant. Deep cool inside. While we wait for chocolate malteds I notice a high-schooler sitting at the counter exchanging looks with the girl next to him. She's gorgeous, and I'm not the only other one who notices it. The girl behind the counter waiting on them is also watching with an anger she thinks no one else sees. Some kind of triangle. We keep passing unseen through little moments of other people's lives."
"White Bird, Idaho",45.76359,-116.2994583,"The road has twisted and rolled over desert hills into a little, narrow thread of green surrounding the town of White Bird, then proceeded on to a big fast river, the Salmon, flowing between high canyon walls. Here the heat is tremendous and the glare from the white canyon rock is blinding. We wind on and on through the bottom of the narrow canyon, nervous about fast-moving traffic and oppressed by the fiery heat."
"Riggins, Idaho",45.4221105,-116.315411,"A town called Riggins comes up and we see a lot of motels, and afterward the road branches away from the canyon and follows a smaller stream. It seems to head upward into forest."
"New Meadows, Idaho",44.9712808,-116.284017,"We wind higher and higher into unexpectedly pleasant, cool, green meadows surrounded by pine forests. At a town called New Meadows we fill up again and buy two cans of oil, still surprised at the change."
"Tamarack, Idaho",44.9551656,-116.3856896,We pass Tamarack and the road drops down again from green meadows into dry sandy country.
"Cambridge, Idaho",44.572596,-116.6760812,"At a town called Cambridge we have supper and when we are finished, it's dark out."
"Prairie City, Oregon",44.4633303,-118.709063,At Prairie City we're out of the mountain forests again and into a dry-land town with a wide main street that looks right down through the center of the town and onto the prairie beyond it.
"Dayville, Oregon",44.4682007,-119.53581,We're pulling into Dayville and my rear end feels like it's turned to concrete.
"Prineville Junction, Oregon",44.3129743,-121.1641466,"We arrive in Prineville Junction with only a few hours of daylight left. We're at the intersection with Highway 97, where we'll turn south, and I fill up the tank at the corner and then am so tired I go around in back and sit on the yellow-painted cement curb with my feet in the gravel and the last rays of the sun flaring through the trees into my eyes."
"Bend Oregon",44.058,-121.315,"At Bend we stop and have supper in a modern restaurant in which people also come and go without looking at each other."
"La Pine, Oregon",43.6703995,-121.503636,At La Pine we stop. I tell Chris to order me ham and eggs for breakfast while I stay outside to change the oil.
"Crater Lake, Oregon",42.94152615,-122.0988203,"We arrive at the turnoff to Crater Lake and go up a neat road into the National Park...clean, tidy and preserved. It really shouldn't be any other way, but this doesn't win any prizes for Quality either. It turns it into a museum. This is how it was before the white man came...beautiful lava flows, and scrawny trees, and not a beer can anywhere...but now that the white man is here, it looks fake. Maybe the National Park Service should set just one pile of beer cans in the middle of all that lava and then it would come to life. The absence of beer cans is distracting."
"Klamath Lake, Oregon",42.3667772,-121.8656151,"We travel down the eastern shore of Klamath Lake on a three-lane highway that contains a lot of nineteen- twenties feeling. That's when these three-laners were all made. We pull in for lunch at a roadhouse which belongs to this era too. Wooden frame badly in need of paint, neon beer signs in the window, gravel and engine drippings for a front lawn."
"Medford, Oregon",42.326515,-122.875595,When we're through the folded hills we come to Medford and a freeway leading to Grants Pass and it's almost evening.
"Grants Pass, Oregon",42.4393707,-123.3272489,
"Crescent City, California",41.85280485,-124.1499052,"The grey rainy skies and sign-strewn road descend to Crescent City, California, grey and cold and wet, and Chris and I look and see the water, the ocean, in the distance beyond piers and grey buildings. I remember this was our great goal all these days."
"Arcata, California",40.866517,-124.08284,"At Arcata we enter a small diner, cold and wet, and eat chili and beans and drink coffee."
"Weott, California",40.3214878,-123.9226034,"We leave and breakfast in a town off the road called Weott, where I see he's still in a distant mood. It's a kind of looking-away mood and a not-talking mood, and I leave him alone."
"Leggett, California",39.8657071,-123.714188,Farther on at Leggett we see a tourist duck pond and we buy Cracker Jacks and throw them to the ducks and he does this in the most unhappy way I have ever seen. Then we pass into some of the twisting coastal range road and suddenly enter heavy fog. Then the temperature drops and I know we're back at the ocean again.
"Mendicino County, California",39.1501662,-123.2077861,"We're on the Mendocino County coast now, and it's all wild and beautiful and open here. The hills are mostly grass but in the lee of rocks and folds in the hills are strange flowing shrubs sculptured by the upsweep of winds from the ocean. We pass some old wooden fences, weathered grey. In the distance is an old weathered and grey farmhouse. How could anyone farm here? The fence is broken in many places. Poor."
"Ukiah, California",39.1501662,-123.2077861,"And so we ride on and on, down through Ukiah, and Hopland, and Cloverdale, down into the wine country. The freeway miles seem so easy now. The engine which has carried us halfway across a continent drones on and on in its continuing oblivion to everything but its own internal forces."
"Hopland, California",38.9729542,-123.1163918,
"Cloverdale, California",38.776218,-122.9930082,
"Asti, California",38.7629643,-122.9730546,"We pass through Asti and Santa Rosa, and Petaluma and Novato, on the freeway that grows wider and fuller now, swelling with cars and trucks and busses full of people, and soon by the road are houses and boats and the water of the Bay."
"Santa Rosa, California",38.4404925,-122.7141049,
"Petaluma, California",38.270022,-122.6061224,
"Novato, California",38.1061979,-122.5681191,
"San Franciso, California",37.779,-122.419,"We pass through Asti and Santa Rosa, and Petaluma and Novato, on the freeway that grows wider and fuller now, swelling with cars and trucks and busses full of people, and soon by the road are houses and boats and the water of the Bay."
